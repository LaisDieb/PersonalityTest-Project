# PersonalityTest-Project
The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits. In this project, machine learning was used for the algorithm to group people with similar personality traits. The business rule was used to define how many groups would be created. As there are five personalities, the ideal would be five groups to group the people who answered the questions in a similar way. However, the Elbow statistical method was used to verify this number.At the end, an interface was developed to consume the machine learning model created.
